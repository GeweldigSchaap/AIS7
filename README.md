# AIS7
In this repository you can find all the needed material for developing the assignments related to the AIS7 course from the 4th year of Mechatronics 

# Introduction
We have prepared a Jetson Nano (2GB), a case for protecting the Jetson Nano and an SD card where you will install an Ubuntu image with two Docker images inside (one for each assignment). The given Ubuntu + Dockers images have all the needed libraries and dependencies for following the tutorials and for developing your assignments. Each assignment contains all the information that you might need for achieving your learning goals. Please look at each assignment folder and read the README.md file for getting to know what is inside the folder and where to find the information that you might seek.

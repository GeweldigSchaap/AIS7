# Assignment 1
This assignment Assignment will consist of Two parts (A and B)

Part A will be about getting acquainted with all tools / hardware / environments and deploying your first learning algorithms on relative simple datasets

Part B will be about analyzing and deploying machine learning on more complex datasets as on your own generated dataset

Before you can start with the first assignment you should first setup your hardware, install the required software and follow some tutorials.

## Preparation


Read these documents first:
- [Background Information](Background_information.md) on used hardware / software.
- Make sure you assembled the hardware and installed the required software and connect to your Jetson

## Tutorials

We provide some tutorials how to get started with Machine Learning / use specific packages / import datasets / analyze data  / display results / implement and compare ML algorithms.
The knowledge learned from these tutorials will be required for making the Assignments.

- Follow [These Tutorials](Tutorials) first before you continue!

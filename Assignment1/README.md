# Assignment 1

This assignment Assignment will consist of Two parts (A and B)

* Part A will be about getting acquainted with all tools / hardware / environments and deploying your first learning algorithms on relative simple datasets

* Part B will be about analyzing and deploying machine learning on more complex datasets as on your own generated dataset

Before you can start with the first assignment you should first setup your hardware, install the required software and follow some tutorials.

## Preparation


Read these documents first:
- [Background Information](Background_information.md) on used hardware / software.
- Make sure you assembled the hardware and installed the required software and connect to your Jetson

## Tutorials

We provide some tutorials how to get started with Machine Learning / use specific packages / import datasets / analyze data  / display results / implement and compare ML algorithms.
The knowledge learned from these tutorials will be required for making the Assignments.

- Follow [These Tutorials](Tutorials) first before you continue!

## Assignment 1 - Part A

> [Assignment1_PART_A.ipynb](Assignment1_PART_A.ipynb)

You can find a jupyter notebook in here.
This notebook contains the assignment description.



## Assignment 1 - Part B

> [Assignment1_partB.md](Assignment1_partB.md)

In Part A you set-up the system and executed your first learning algorithm.
In part B you will analyze real data and generate a dataset for your own learning problem.

## Deliverables

At the end you have to hand in this notebook together with all the notebook of Assignment 1. when you hand it in you should make sure that you saved it with all output visible. So we can evaluate your notebooks output without directly ruinning it. In addition (to be sure) you should also save a pdf of the final result.

For this assignment we also want a short video which shows all the design steps (form collecting data till deployment), in this video you should show and explain us what you did, which design choices you made and why

Final deliverables Assignment 1:

* Notebooks Part A, Part B1, Part B2 (saved after execution, so all outputs are visible)
* A pdf of these notebooks in the same state (as backup)
* Your custom data(sets), so we can run your code
* A video (max 3 minutes) explaining & showing the process and result of Part B2
